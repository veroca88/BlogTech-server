## 🧐 Problem?

Has it ever happened to you (as self-taught dev) when you found a good resource you open a new tab and keep that window open because someday you will need it... and then you have so many open tabs that you start to save it as a bookmark by finally that day arrives and you don't remember that you had saved those good resources... 🤔 !!
